Visual interpretation of hand gestures for human-computer interaction: a review,"The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI).

Eye Tracking in Human-Computer Interaction and Usability Research,"Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the application of eye movements to user interfaces, both for analyzing interfaces (measuring usability) and as an actual control medium within a human‚Äìcomputer dialogue. For usability analysis, user's are recorded during system use later analyzed retrospectively; however, do not affect interface in real time. As direct medium, obtained used time input user‚Äìcomputer The might be sole input, typically disabled users or hands-busy applications, one several inputs, combining with mouse, keyboard, sensors, other devices. From perspective mainstream eye-movement research, interaction, together related work broader field communications media appears new very promising area applied work.

The Scope and Importance of Human Interruption in Human-Computer Interaction Design,"Abstract At first glance it seems absurd that busy people doing important jobs should want their computers to interrupt them. Interruptions are disruptive and need concentrate make good decisions. However, successful job performance also frequently depends on people's abilities (a) constantly monitor dynamically changing information environments, (b) collaborate communicate with other in the system, (c) supervise background autonomous services. These critical can require simultaneously query a large set of sources, continuously for events, respond human operators.
