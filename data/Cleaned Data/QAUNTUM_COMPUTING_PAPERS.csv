Quantum computing in molecular magnets,"Shor and Grover demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform any classical in factoring numbers1 searching database2 by exploiting the parallelism of mechanics. Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition entanglement many-particle system3, single-particle states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm4. Recently, latter has been successfully implemented5 using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation uses molecular magnets6,7,8,9,10, which are solid-state systems with large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates systems. We show theoretically magnets be used to build dense efficient memory devices based on algorithm. In particular, one single crystal serve as storage unit dynamic random access device.

Because essential role measurement, irreversible. In computer, order choices determine algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit states encoded into polarization state four photons. characterize fully implementing experimental tomography. Using state, demonstrate feasibility computing through universal set one- two-qubit operations. Finally, implementation Grover's search demonstrates ideally suited such tasks.

Quantum chaos border for quantum computing,"We study a generic model of quantum computer, composed many qubits coupled by short-range interaction. Above critical interqubit coupling strength, chaos sets in, leading to ergodicity the computer eigenstates. In this regime noninteracting qubit structure disappears, eigenstates become complex, and operability is destroyed. Despite fact that spacing between multiqubit states drops exponentially with number n, we show border decreases only linearly n. This opens broad parameter region where efficient operation remains possible.",2000-09-01,https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.62.3504,"Bertrand Georgeot, Dima L.

Why I am optimistic about the silicon-photonic route to quantum computing,"This is a short overview explaining how building large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon needs pass through small, constant, number components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering already demonstrated manufacture thousands components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips performance that, once scaled up, allows tens photons in state universal for computation. At present fully integrated, architecture we envisage involves creating required by starting single-photons produced non-deterministically pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined on-chip filters nanowire superconducting detectors herald that produced. These are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, single then passed an interferometer produce small states—necessarily near-determinism again. followed “ballistic” scattering small-scale some detected, leaving remainder large-scale which provably computing implemented single-photon measurements.
