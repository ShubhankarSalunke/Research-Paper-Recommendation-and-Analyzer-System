50 Years of Data Science,"More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten 20 Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged statistics expand its boundaries beyond classical domain theoretical statistics; Chambers more emphasis on data preparation presentation rather statistical modeling; prediction inference. Cleveland Wu even suggested catchy name science” this envisioned field. A recent growing phenomenon has been emergence programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, most prominently, University Michigan, which in September 2015 announced $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims hire 35 new faculty. Teaching these significant overlap curricular matter with traditional courses; yet many statisticians perceive as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients current science moment,” commentary about popular media, how/whether is really different The now-contemplated field amounts superset fields machine learning, adds technology “scaling up” “big data.” chosen motivated by commercial intellectual developments.

Veridical data science,"Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning, scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, composed both a workflow documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, transparent results across science life cycle. The PCS uses predictability as reality check considers importance computation in collection/storage algorithm design. It augments computability with an overarching principle. Stability expands statistical uncertainty considerations assess how human judgment calls impact through model/algorithm perturbations. As part workflow, develop inference procedures, namely perturbation intervals hypothesis testing, investigate relative problem formulation, cleaning, modeling decisions, interpretations. We illustrate neuroscience genomics projects our own others. Moreover, demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods terms receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including wide range misspecified models.
