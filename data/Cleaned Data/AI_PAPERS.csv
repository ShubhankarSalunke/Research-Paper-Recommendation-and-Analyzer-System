Steps toward Artificial Intelligence,"The problems of heuristic programming-of making computers solve really difficult problems-are divided into five main areas: Search, Pattern-Recognition, Learning, Planning, and Induction. A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how certain problem, may program machine (computer) Search through some large space solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency often be improved, by restricting the application machine's methods appropriate problems. together with used exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing situation, using Planning methods, obtain fundamental improvement replacing given search much smaller, more exploration.

The rise of super computing power Big Data technologies appear to have empowered recent years. new generation is rapidly expanding again become an attractive topic research. This paper aims identify the challenges associated with use impact revitalised based systems decision making offer a set research propositions information (IS) researchers. first provides view history through relevant papers published International Journal Information Management (IJIM). It then discusses general specific issues regarding interaction integration support or replace human makers particular. To advance on era Data, offers twelve IS researchers terms conceptual theoretical development, technology-human interaction, implementation.",2019-10-01,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.021,"Yanqing Duan, John S.
