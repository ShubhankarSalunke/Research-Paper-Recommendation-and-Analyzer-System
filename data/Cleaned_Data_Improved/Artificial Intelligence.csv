History of artificial intelligence in medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) was first described in 1950; however, several limitations early models prevented widespread acceptance and application to medicine. In the 2000s, many of these were overcome by advent deep learning. Now that AI systems are capable analyzing complex algorithms self-learning, we enter a new age medicine where can be applied clinical practice through risk assessment models, improving diagnostic accuracy workflow efficiency.

The promise of artificial intelligence in chemical engineering Is it here finally,"The current excitement about artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), is palpable and contagious. expectation that AI poised to “revolutionize,” perhaps even take over, humanity has elicited prophetic visions concerns from some luminaries.1-4 There also a great deal of interest in the commercial potential AI, which attracting significant sums venture capital state-sponsored investment globally, China.5 McKinsey, for instance, predicts impact several domains, envisioning markets worth trillions dollars.6 All this driven by sudden, explosive, surprising advances made last 10 years or so. AlphaGo, autonomous cars, Alexa, Watson, other such systems, game playing, robotics, computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing are indeed stunning advances. But, as with earlier breakthroughs, expert systems 1980s neural networks 1990s, there considerable hype tendency overestimate promise these advances, market research firm Gartner others have noted emerging technology.7 It quite understandable many chemical engineers excited applications ML particular,8 use catalyst design.9-11 might seem prospect offers novel approach challenging, long-standing problems engineering using AI.

Data mostly form tables objects individuals rows variables, either numerical categorical, columns. roughly divided into supervised unsupervised methods. Unsupervised occurs when purpose identify groups within according commonalities, priori knowledge number significance. Supervised training contain represented input–output pairs. Input comprises individual descriptors, whereas output outcomes interest predicted—either class classification tasks value regression tasks.
