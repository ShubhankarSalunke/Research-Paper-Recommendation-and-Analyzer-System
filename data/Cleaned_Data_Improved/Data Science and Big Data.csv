Perspective Materials informatics and big data Realization of the fourth paradigm of science in materials science,"Our ability to collect “big data” has greatly surpassed our capability analyze it, underscoring the emergence of fourth paradigm science, which is data-driven discovery. The need for data informatics also emphasized by Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), further boosting emerging field materials informatics. In this article, we look at how techniques are playing a big role in deciphering processing-structure-property-performance relationships materials, with illustrative examples both forward models (property prediction) and inverse (materials discovery). Such analytics can significantly reduce time-to-insight accelerate cost-effective discovery, goal MGI.",15-04-2016,APL Materials,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4946894,"Ankit Agrawal, Alok Choudhary",885,Our ability to collect big data has greatly surpassed our capability analyze it underscoring the emergence of fourth paradigm science which is datadriven discovery The need for data informatics also emphasized by Materials Genome Initiative MGI further boosting emerging field materials informatics In this article we look at how techniques are playing a big role in deciphering processingstructurepropertyperformance relationships materials with illustrative examples both forward models property prediction and inverse materials discovery Such analytics can significantly reduce timetoinsight accelerate costeffective discovery goal MGI,ability collect big datum greatly surpass capability analyze underscore emergence fourth paradigm science datadriven discovery need data informatic emphasize material genome initiative mgi boost emerge field material informatic article look technique play big role decipher processingstructurepropertyperformance relationship material illustrative example forward model property prediction inverse material discovery analytic significantly reduce timetoinsight accelerate costeffective discovery goal mgi
Big Data of Materials Science Critical Role of the Descriptor,"Statistical learning of materials properties or functions so far starts with a largely silent, nonchallenged step: the choice set descriptive parameters (termed descriptor). However, when scientific connection between descriptor and actuating mechanisms is unclear, causality learned descriptor-property relation uncertain. Thus, trustful prediction new promising materials, identification anomalies, advancement are doubtful. We analyze this issue define requirements for suitable descriptor. For classic example, energy difference zinc blende wurtzite rocksalt semiconductors, we demonstrate how meaningful can be found systematically.",10-03-2015,Physical Review Letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.114.105503,"Luca M.

Increasingly however, game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies addition training collected novel miniature sensor have become for research.

Towards efficient data exchange and sharing for bigdata driven materials science metadata and data formats,"Abstract With big-data driven materials research, the new paradigm of science, sharing and wide accessibility data are becoming crucial aspects. Obviously, a prerequisite for exchange analytics is standardization, which means using consistent unique conventions for, e.g., units, zero base lines, file formats.

One accepts heterogeneous nature community, comprises scientists from physics, chemistry, bio-physics, by complying with diverse ecosystem computer codes thus develops “converters” input output files all important codes. These converters then translate each code into standardized, code-independent format. The other strategy provide standardized open libraries that developers can adopt shaping their inputs, outputs, restart files, directly same In perspective paper, we present both argue they should be regarded as complementary, if not even synergetic. represented appropriate format were agreed upon teams, Electronic Structure Library (ESL) European Center Atomic Molecular Computations (CECAM) NOvel MAterials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory, Centre Excellence (CoE).

BigDataDriven Stem Cell Science and Tissue Engineering Vision and Unique Opportunities,"Achieving the promises of stem cell science to generate precise disease models and designer samples for personalized therapeutics will require harnessing pheno-genotypic cell-level data quantitatively predictively in lab clinic. Those requirements could be met by developing a Big-Data-driven strategy community. Stem has seen revolution past decade. With advent human pluripotent (hPSC) technologies 10 years ago more recently that CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering organoid technologies, scope field expanded significantly encompass Biomimetic Engineering, which provide, not-so-far future, ""designer"" cells tissues organs study treatment countless diseases ranging from heart liver failure sickle anemia, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease. To achieve unique goal, need harness ""omics"" Big Data—that is, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, microscopic, metabolomic, other such information—to learn how efficiently, specifically, safely produce best match those each intended target patient. We propose this can attained defining collaborative data-driven science, specifically (1) coordinating efforts community share high-quality reference datasets, used qualitatively different cell/tissue/organ types differ between individuals; (2) engaging with computational biology community, is currently under-represented pivotal needed both leverage integrate biological omics Data establish much pheno-genomic information enough consider or tissue as acceptable responsible therapeutic use.

Reconciling big data and thick data to advance the new urban science and smart city governance,"Amid growing enthusiasm for a ""new urban science"" and ""smart city"" approaches to management, ""big data"" is expected create radical new opportunities research practice. Meanwhile, anthropologists, sociologists, human geographers, among others, generate highly contextualized nuanced data, sometimes referred as 'thick data,' that can potentially complement, refine calibrate big data analytics while generating interpretations of the city through diverse forms reasoning. While researchers in range fields have begun consider such questions, scholars affairs not yet engaged these discussions. The article explores how ethnographic could be reconciled with data-driven inquiry into phenomena.

Raiders of the lost HARK a reproducible inference framework for big data science,"Abstract Hypothesizing after the results are known (HARK) has been disparaged as data dredging, and safeguards including hypothesis preregistration statistically rigorous oversight have recommended.

Some of precautions can conflict with modern reality researchers’ obligations to use big, ‘organic’ sources—from high-throughput genomics social media streams. We here propose a HARK-solid, reproducible inference framework suitable for big data, based on models that represent formalization hypotheses. Reproducibility is attained by employing two levels model validation: internal (relative collated around hypotheses) external (independent hypotheses used generate or hypotheses). With model-centered paradigm, reproducibility focus changes from ability others reproduce both specific inferences study evaluate representation reality.

Mayo,4,Alone we can do so little together much  Helen Keller At its core the concept of big data in health care embraces promise creating transcendent knowledge generation systems using power information gathered from routine processes for all patients By harnessing largescale aggregation generated during healthcare delivery to speed and capacity machine learning ML artificial intelligence AI algorithms pioneers believe reduce research costs deepen our understanding factors affecting patient outcomes improve care Ability ML AI identify characterize interactions among sets variables cohorts patients larger than humans are capable analyzing should key quality These early days with substantial amounts foundational work needed reach that promise Part foundation includes improving standardizations quantifying data elements building increase volume may be consumed by these hungry algorithms analogy consider love fast powerful convenient cars Without constructing roads bridges
