ARHPE Asymmetric RelationAware Representation Learning for Head Pose Estimation in Industrial HumanComputer Interaction,"Head pose estimation (HPE) has wide industrial applications, such as online education, human–robot interaction, and automatic manufacturing. In this article, we address two key problems in HPE based on label learning asymmetric relation cues: 1) how to bridge the gap between better prediction performance of networks incorrectly images datasets 2) take full advantage adjacent poses information around centered image. We reconstruct all incorrect labels a two-dimensional Lorentz distribution tackle first problem.
