Unfortunately, full anonymity always desirable, because malicious are able conduct illegal transactions, such as money laundering and drug trading, under cover cryptocurrencies. As result, regulation very essential.

Corporate Governance for Complex Cryptocurrencies A Framework for Stability and Decision Making in BlockchainBased Organizations,"Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum are gaining ground not only alternative modes of payment, but also platforms for financial innovation, particularly through token sales (ICOs). All these ventures based on decentralized, permissionless blockchain technology whose distinguishing characteristics their openness to, and the formal equality of, participants. However, recent cryptocurrency crises have shown that architectures lack robust governance frameworks therefore prone to patterns re-centralization: they informally dominated by coalitions powerful players within ecosystem who may violate basic rules community without accountability sanction.Against this background, paper makes two novel contributions. First, it suggests token-based ecosystems can be fruitfully analyzed complex systems been studied decades in complexity theory recently gained prominence regulation, too. It applies insights three key case studies: Bitcoin Hard Fork 2013; Ethereum hard fork 2016, following DAO hack; ongoing scaling debate. Second, argues complexity-induced uncertainty reduced, elements stability order strengthened, adapting a corporate framework blockchain-based organizations: cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications built top them via sales. Most importantly, resulting “comply explain” approach combines transparency with necessary flexibility allows developers continue experiment sake innovation.

Characterizing key agents in the cryptocurrency economy through blockchain transaction analysis,"Abstract The cryptocurrency economy provides a comprehensive digital trace of human economic behavior: almost all users’ activities are faithfully recorded in transactions on public blockchains. However, the user identifiers transaction records, i.e., blockchain addresses, anonymous. That is, they cannot be associated with any real “off-chain” identify actual users. Nonetheless, identifying roles addresses from their past behaviors is still feasible. This paper analyzes Ethereum token transactions, characterizes key agents’ behavior patterns, and explores identifiability through interpretable machine learning models. Specifically, six types most active agents considered, including centralized exchanges, decentralized wallets, issuers, airdrop services, gaming services. Transaction patterns such as trading volume, tempo, structural properties networks defined for individual addresses. results showed that exchanges online wallets have signature hence can accurately distinguished other agents.

Existing vulnerabilities further amplified by impending existential threat from quantum computers.

A LowCost CrossBorder Payment System Based on Auditable Cryptocurrency With Consortium Blockchain Joint Digital Currency,"Due to the involvement of a large number intermediaries across different time zones in correspondent banking process, existing interbank payment systems cannot provide cost-effective cross-border transactions.

NEW FINANCIAL BUSINESS MODELS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONCEPT OF DIGITAL FINANCIALIZATION,"Finansallaşma, kapitalizmin son kırk yıllık dönüşümünü açıklayan önemli kavramlardan biridir. Dijital ve finansal alanda yaşanan gelişmeler dikkate alındığında, teknoloji ile finansallaşma arasında güçlü bir bağ bulunmaktadır. Yüzyılın başından bu yana hızla yükselen büyük şirketlerinin iş modelleri, dijital alanı giderek daha fazla bütünleştirmektedir. Bu bağlamda, alanların bütünleşmesi, literatüründe olarak tanımlanan yeni kavram ortaya çıkarmıştır. Finansal alandaki dönüşüme öncülük eden dijitalleşme, 2008 yılı itibariyle dönüşümün aşaması olan blok zincir teknolojisi kripto para piyasalarını sisteme dâhil etmiştir. Blok teknolojisinin modelleri piyasaları, oldukça dinamik alandır.
