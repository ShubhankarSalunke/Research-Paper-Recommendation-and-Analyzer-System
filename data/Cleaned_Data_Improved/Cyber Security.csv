A recent review of conventional vs automated cybersecurity antiphishing techniques,"In the era of electronic and mobile commerce, massive numbers financial transactions are conducted online on daily basis, which created potential fraudulent opportunities. A common activity that involves creating a replica trustful website to deceive users illegally obtain their credentials is phishing. Website phishing serious fraud, costing banks, users, governments, other organisations severe damages. One conventional approach combat raise awareness educate novice different tactics utilised by phishers conducting periodic training or workshops. However, this has been criticised being not cost effective as constantly changing besides it may require high operational cost. Another anti-phishing legislate amend existing cyber security laws persecute fraudsters without minimising its severity. more promising prevent attacks using intelligent machine learning (ML) technology.

Whats in a Name Metaphors and Cybersecurity,"Abstract For more than a decade, the United States military has conceptualized and discussed Internet related systems as “cyberspace,” understood “domain” of conflict like land, sea, air, outer space. How why did this concept become entrenched in US doctrine? What are its effects? Focusing on emergence consolidation terminology, I make three arguments about role language cybersecurity policy.

These metaphors support specific ways to understand complex issues, provide discursive resources some over others, shape policy contestation outcomes. Second, present detailed empirical study strategy doctrine that traces terminology built “cyberspace domain.” This supported implicit metaphorical correspondences between physical space, yielding analogies for understanding effects.

CIS provides members with improved situational awareness prepare for respond future cyberthreats. Privacy preservation critical context, since organizations can be reluctant share information otherwise. This particularly when facilitated through untrusted infrastructure provided by third party (e.g., the cloud). Despite this, current data formats protocols do not guarantee any form of privacy participants. In paper we introduce PRACIS, scheme networks that guarantees private forwarding aggregation.

A Bayesian network approach for cybersecurity risk assessment implementing and extending the FAIR model,"Quantitative risk assessment can play a crucial role in effective decision making about cybersecurity strategies. The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is one the most popular models for quantitative assessment. It provides taxonomic framework to classify into set quantifiable factors and combines this with algorithms, form kind Monte Carlo (MC) simulation combined statistical approximation techniques, estimate risk. However, FAIR algorithms restrict both type distributions that be used expandability model structure. Moreover, applied techniques (including using cached data interpolation methods) introduce inaccuracy model. To address restrictions model, we develop more flexible alternative approach, which call FAIR-BN, implement Bayesian Networks (BNs). evaluate performance use MC method (FAIR-MC) calculations without any adopted by FAIR, thus avoiding corresponding introduced. We compare empirical results generated FAIR-BN against large number samples FAIR-MC.

Ensuring cybersecurity of smart grid against data integrity attacks under concept drift,"For achieving increasing artificial intelligence in future smart grids, a very precise state estimation (SE) is required as prerequisite for many other key functionalities successful monitoring and control. With interconnection of utility network internet, traditional estimators are vulnerable to complex data integrity attacks, such false injection (FDI), bypassing existing bad detection (BDD) schemes. While researchers propose detectors FDI, countermeasures neglect power changes due contingencies. As an abrupt physical change negatively affects FDI detectors, they will provide incorrect classification the new instances. To resolve problem, we conducted analysis fundamental understanding differences between grid manipulation change.

A Bayesian network approach for cybersecurity risk assessment implementing and extending the FAIR model,"Quantitative risk assessment can play a crucial role in effective decision making about cybersecurity strategies. The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is one the most popular models for quantitative assessment.

However, FAIR algorithms restrict both type distributions that be used expandability model structure. Moreover, applied techniques (including using cached data interpolation methods) introduce inaccuracy model. To address restrictions model, we develop more flexible alternative approach, which call FAIR-BN, implement Bayesian Networks (BNs). evaluate performance use MC method (FAIR-MC) calculations without any adopted by FAIR, thus avoiding corresponding introduced. We compare empirical results generated FAIR-BN against large number samples FAIR-MC.
