Automated cropland mapping of continental Africa using Google Earth Engine cloud computing,"The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, limited access to local knowledge.

In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge croplands available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter five-meter) imagery (VHRI), (c) captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports literature. study used 16-day time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited 250-m for entire African continent.
